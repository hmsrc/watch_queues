======================
1. General background
======================

Sometimes we like to see some stats about how busy the cluster is, but are too lazy to fire up a web browser.  And we have too many queues, so it's good to filter out the ones noone is using at the moment.  For kicks, we threw in some utilization numbers.

Have fun.

2. More
======================


I wish there was more, but there is not.
